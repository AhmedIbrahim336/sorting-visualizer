# Sorting Visualizer 


 Program made with React and Material-UI for visualizing sorting algorithms. 

I built this application because I was fascinated by sorting algorithms, and I wanted to visualize them in action. 

Features: Prev and next buttons to control the steps, custom array sizes, custom sorting speed.  

Applying Heap Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort
